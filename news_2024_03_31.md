  > I think the only way to start an AI chip company is to start with the software. The computing in ML is not general purpose computing. 95% of models in use today (including LLMs and image generation) have all their compute and memory accesses statically computable.

- 10x-developer
  10x 应该只是一个抽象的概念, 程序员的生产力缺乏量化的评价指标, 10x 的意义在于不断的促进个人和整个团队效率的提升, 工作的核心始终围绕着如何高效高质量的解决实际问题
  成为 10x 的前提是成为一名合格且优秀的程序员(充分了解涉及软件/lib 的细节, 充分了解软件系统和硬件系统基础, 尽可能的了解业务, 并接受失败和无知)

  What is duck typing?

  ```
  The idea is that you don't need to specify a type in order to invoke an existing method on an object - if a method is defined on it, you can invoke it.
  The name comes from the phrase "If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck".
  ```
