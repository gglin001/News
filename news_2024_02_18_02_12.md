  AI, Rising Chip Complexity Complicate Prototyping

  ```
   Simulation, emulation, and prototyping are like three legs of a virtual stool. Typically, that starts with simulation, a software-based verification methodology, where a representation of the design is created in software, whether it‚Äôs VHDL, Verilog, SystemVerilog or SystemC. ‚ÄúBy its very nature, simulation is only as good as the set of questions you ask at the testbench,‚Äù Jaeger noted. ‚ÄúAnd because it‚Äôs all running on a computer in software, it‚Äôs also the slowest of those methodologies.‚Äù

  Emulation goes a step further, with the design mapped into the emulator itself. ‚ÄúThe design is run on a piece of hardware, and you can view the emulator as a massively parallel compute engine, an accelerator, for the simulation,‚Äù Jaeger said. ‚ÄúThen, because the emulation is running fast enough, in addition to the test bench, you also can apply real-world stimuli and connect a real monitor or keyboard or mouse to it. That makes a more complete verification environment because you‚Äôre no longer dependent on the questions you ask the test bench.‚Äù

  Prototyping takes that yet a step further, effectively creating a digital twin of the design, which is mapped into FPGAs, letting the functionality of ASICs be tested before they go into silicon. FPGA-based prototyping is usually the final step in a three-step process.

  ‚ÄúAll three are complementary to each other and are used in different phases in your project,‚Äù said Ant√≥nio Costa, director of product marketing at Synopsys. ‚ÄúOn a prototype, you can have the real-world interface. If you want to interact with PCIe 5.0, for example, you need a prototype that runs at very high performance. The only way to do this compliance test is to run that interface at speed with the software you are planning to use in your SoC.‚Äù
